A simple Plinko game created in Python using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and the **Pygame** library. The goal of the game is to realistically simulate ball collisions and drops, then calculate a final score.  

## Key Features ‚ú®  
- **Object-oriented design**: Game elements (balls, pegs, board) are organized into classes.  
- **Physics simulation**: Ball movement models gravity and collisions.  
- **Graphical interface**: Interactive visualization built with Pygame.  
- **Dynamic scoring**: Points are calculated based on the ball's final landing position.  

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è  
1. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash  
   pip install pygame
